The main code is in `main.py`, and it consists of six parts:

1. Data preprocessing

2. Calculating the initial depression area (CDD)

3. Calculating the geometric properties of the CDD

4. Correcting the flow direction

5. Calculating the runoff accumulation, endorheic basin, and river network

6. River verification and watershed verification

The plotting code is located in `draw.py`, and running it will generate the corresponding subplots.

Please refer to the function comments for the specific functionality of the code.
